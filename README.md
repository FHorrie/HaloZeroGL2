# Halo Zero: SDL Remake

###### Made by Finian Horrie

Halo Zero is a project I made approximately 6 months after starting my learning journey in C++

The project is made in a custom engine provided by Howest Digital Arts & Entertainment. It uses SDL2 as a backend for visuals.

It was a major leap in development knowledge and skills from my side, as it was the first project I made that has a complete game loop.

Being made in C++, at the time I did not use many of the C++ standard features. The code presented is of a lower quality standard than what I believe I do now.
